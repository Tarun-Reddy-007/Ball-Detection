-> Collect 100-200 images of the object you wish to detect and label them using labelImg or any other annotator softwares. 
-> Put the images and annotated files in one folder and convert it into a zip file. 
-> Google Colab can be used for training the Yolov3 model by uploading the zip file. 
-> The weights will be saved in your google drive.
-> The weights file should be downloaded.
-> The path to the weights file should be provided in the detect.py file. 
-> All the packages should be installed in your system.
